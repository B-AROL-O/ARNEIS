The **ARNEIS** (short for `A`utomated `R`ecognizer, `N`etwork-`E`nabled, `I`tem `S`orter) project is the winner of the Popular Vote of the [OpenCV Spatial AI Contest](https://opencv.org/opencv-spatial-ai-contest/) sponsored by [Intel&reg;](https://www.intel.com/) and [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/).

## ARNEIS in a nutshell

ARNEIS aims at reproducing in scale a packaging machine for the [Industry-4.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Industrial_Revolution), thanks to a combination of:

1. An [OAK-D-Lite](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/hardware/en/latest/pages/DM9095.html) Spatial AI camera
2. A lot of [LEGO&reg; Technic](https://www.lego.com/) parts
3. An intelligent combination of both existing and new Open Source software...
4. ... deployed to a hybrid [Kubernetes cluster](https://kubernetes.io/) made with resources
   - partly on [Azure cloud](https://azure.microsoft.com/) running on [Intel&reg;](https://www.intel.com/) hardware
   - partly on the edge using either a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) or other [Embedded Linux](https://linuxfoundation.org/) devices.

## ARNEIS Project documentation

Even though the machine is made of LEGO&reg;, we strived to develop the project in a professional way as we are used in our daily job.
With this in mind we have released at <https://arneis.readthedocs.io/> the complete documentation of the ARNEIS project, including:

- functional specifications
- system and software architecture documents
- design documents with detailed instructions for reproducing the machine
- system integration and validation documents

However, as the old adage says (and [we learned it the hard way](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/learned+the+hard+way))

> [One picture is worth a thousand words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_picture_is_worth_a_thousand_words)

here is a 3-minute video which we submitted to the OpenCV Spatial AI Contest final on 2022-04-04:

The source files for the software programs, the LEGO&reg; MOC as well as the documentation site are maintained in the GitHub repository at <https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS>.
Whenever the `main` branch of the git repository is updated, <https://arneis.readthedocs.io/> will be updated accordingly.

### The ARNEIS MOC

We have designed a MOC (My Own Creation) using the parts from [LEGO&reg; Set 42100](https://arneis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lego-set-42100/README.html) (Liebherr R 9800 Excavator).

### The ARNEIS Software Architecture

The software architecture is based on microservices running on a hybrid Kubernetes cluster.
Please refer to <https://arneis.readthedocs.io> for details.

### The Computer Vision and Machine Learning

The OAK-D-Lite captures photos of the bottles flowing through the conveyor and runs a Neural Network trained on a custom dataset to be able to classify and recognize the type (Part Number) of the bottle. This information is fed in real-time to the Raspberry Pi which - based on the job order - decides whether to eject the bottle to the final packaging unit, or putting it back to the parts warehouse.

### ARNEIS project roadmap and timeline

The ARNEIS project roadmap is [kept updated on GitHub](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/milestones?direction=asc%26sort=due_date%26state=open).

[Gianpaolo Macario](https://github.com/gmacario/) publishes regular updates of the ARNEIS project on [his personal blog](https://gmacario.github.io/posts).
