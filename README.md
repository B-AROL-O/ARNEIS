The **ARNEIS** (short for `A`utomated `R`ecognizer, `N`etwork-`E`nabled, `I`tem Sorter) project is one of the 50 selected finalists of the [OpenCV Spatial AI Contest](https://opencv.org/opencv-spatial-ai-contest/) sponsored by [Intel&reg;](https://www.intel.com/) and [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/).

## ARNEIS in a nutshell

ARNEIS aims at reproducing in scale a packaging machine for the [Industry-4.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Industrial_Revolution).

This goal is achieved by means of a combination of:
- An [OAK-D-Lite](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/hardware/en/latest/pages/DM9095.html) Spatial AI camera
- A lot of [LEGO&reg; Technic](https://www.lego.com/) parts
- ... and plenty of Open Source software

## ARNEIS Project documentation

As the old adage says and we learned it the hard way

> [One picture is worth a thousand words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_picture_is_worth_a_thousand_words)

<!-- In the case of ARNEIS we would probably need one million words to explain it, so -->
here is a ~5 min video which we submitted to the OpenCV Spatial AI Contest final on 2022-04-03:

<!-- TODO: Update when final version is released -->

<!-- You will find the complete documentation, including

* TODO -->

The complete documentation of the ARNEIS project, including architecture documents and detailed instructions for reproducing the design and the use cases described in the video, is available at <https://arneis.readthedocs.io/>.

The source files for the software programs, the LEGO&reg; MOC as well as the documentation site are maintained in the GitHub repository at <https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS>.

Whenever the `main` branch of the git repository is updated, <https://arneis.readthedocs.io/> will be updated accordingly.

### The ARNEIS MOC

We have designed a MOC (My Own Creation) using the parts from [LEGO&reg; Set 42100](https://arneis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lego-set-42100/README.html) (Liebherr R 9800 Excavator).
