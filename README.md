The **ARNEIS** (short for `A`utomated `R`ecognizer, `N`etwork-`E`nabled, `I`tems Sorter) project is one of the 50 selected finalists of the [OpenCV Spatial AI Contest](https://opencv.org/opencv-spatial-ai-contest/) sponsored by [Intel&reg;](https://www.intel.com/) and [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/).

## ARNEIS in a nutshell

ARNEIS aims at reproducing in scale a packaging machine for the [Industry-4.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Industrial_Revolution).

This goal is achieved by means of a combination of:
- An [OAK-D-Lite](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/hardware/en/latest/pages/DM9095.html) Spatial AI camera
- A lot of [LEGO&reg; Technic](https://www.lego.com/) parts
- ... and plenty of Open Source software
