## First Conveyor (v.001)

This is the first idea of a conveyor used to move bottles. The main idea is to use a chain where some kind of _pushers_ are used to move bottles over a flat surface.

The chain is not used as a base surface for the bottles for the difficulty of maintaining the chain as an flat orizontal base during the movement.

## Bottle Conveyor (2022-01-22)

This is the evolution of the **First Conveyor (v.001)** idea.

This project represent the complete structure needed to sustain the chain.

The parts used in this design are all from the LEGO&reg; [42100 Liebherr R9800](https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?S=42100-1) set.

Main features of this design are:
- smooth bottle sliding surface
- adjustable chain tensioner
- easily reconfigurable bottle pushers
