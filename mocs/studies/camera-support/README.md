# OAK-D-Lite LEGO&reg; mechanical adapter

Main goal of this project is to construct a mechanical support for the [OAK-D-Lite](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/hardware/en/latest/pages/DM9095.html#dm9095) camera, by using only LEGO&reg; Technics parts.

## Main features

* Light and simple frame
* Leaves the dissipation surface uncovered
* Stable fastening
* Quick and easy way to dis/assemble camera from/to the adapter
* Easy access to the USB port
