### Display assigned IP addresses

To know the IP addresses assigned to the Raspberry Pi just move the mouse over the network icon at the top right of the desktop

![2022-01-21-2123-rpios-desktop-ipaddr.png](../images/2022-01-21-2123-rpios-desktop-ipaddr.png)


### Configure hostname, SSH and VNC

<!-- (2022-01-12 10:10 CET) -->

Open a terminal and type the following command

```bash
sudo raspi-config
```

* Select "1" (System Options), then "S4" (Hostname)
* Enter hostname: `rpi4gm35` (will replace default hostname `raspberrypi`)
* Select "3" (Interface Options), then "I2" (SSH)
* Select "Yes" to enable SSH
* Select "3" (Interface Options), then "I3" (VNC)
* Select "Yes" to enable VNC
* Select "Finish" to exit `raspi-config`. Reboot if requested

Verify that the RPi is accessible from the laptop via SSH and VNC
(you may need to scan the local Wi-Fi network to get the IPv4 address assigned by the router)

HINT: To scan the network and identify the open services you can use one of those tools

- The [Fing app](https://www.fing.com/) on a mobile phone or on your laptop.
- [nmap](https://nmap.org/)

It this works disconnect the USB keyboard, mouse and display

![2022-01-12-1038-rpi4b-boxed](../images/2022-01-12-1038-rpi4b-boxed.jpg)

Reboot your RPi4 and verify that the device is still accessible from SSH:

```text
gmacario@alpha:~$ ssh pi@rpird102.local
pi@rpird102.local's password:
Linux rpird102 5.15.32-v8+ #1538 SMP PREEMPT Thu Mar 31 19:40:39 BST 2022 aarch64

pi@rpird102:~ $
```

Do the same using a VNC client (in my case I used the free to use [VNC&reg; Viewer](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/))

![2022-01-13-1731-vnc-connect.png](../images/2022-01-13-1731-vnc-connect.png)

Double click on the selected profile to connect to the remote desktop of the Raspberry Pi:

### (Recommended) Create a public DNS entry

If you have administrative rights to a DNS zone you may choose to access your Raspberry Pi using a symbolic name rather than an IP address.

If so, access your DNS administrative page (in my case, <https://register.it/>) and create an A record to map the name to the IP address assigned to your Raspberry Pi.

In my case

> `A rpi4gm35 172.30.48.18`

Wait until the DNS zone is propagated, then verify that the device can be accessed by another host (in our case, our laptop) using the assigned name rather than its IP address:

```bash
gpmacario@HW2457 MINGW64 ~
$ ping rpi4gm35.gmacario.it

Esecuzione di Ping rpi4gm35.gmacario.it [172.30.48.18] con 32 byte di dati:

    Minimo = 6ms, Massimo =  8ms, Medio =  6ms

gpmacario@HW2457 MINGW64 ~
$
```

### Configure public SSH keypair

Logged in as pi@rpird102, create a public/private SSH keypair:

```bash
ssh-keygen
```

Type the following commands to be able to login to your Raspberry Pi through your public SSH key - for instance:

```bash
cat <<END >>~/.ssh/authorized_keys
ssh-rsa AAAAB3Nza....W1cG35r8= gpmacario@HW2457
END
```

Test


```bash
gpmacario@HW2457 MINGW64 ~
$ ssh pi@rpi4gm35.gmacario.it

# Configure git-aware-prompt
export GITAWAREPROMPT=~/.bash/git-aware-prompt
source "\${GITAWAREPROMPT}/main.sh"
export PS1="\${debian_chroot:+(\$debian_chroot)}\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\]:\[\033[01;34m\]\w\[\033[00m\] \[$txtcyn\]\$git_branch\[$txtred\]\$git_dirty\[$txtrst\]\$ "
END
```

Logout and login for applying the changes.

Now when inside a directory versioned with git your prompt should show the branch where you are in, as in the following example

```text
pi@rpi4gm35:~/.bash/git-aware-prompt (master)$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
pi@rpi4gm35:~/.bash/git-aware-prompt (master)$

The following line gives us some suggestions:

```text
[INFO]  Failed to find memory cgroup, you may need to add "cgroup_memory=1 cgroup_enable=memory" to your linux cmdline (/boot/cmdline.txt on a Raspberry Pi)
```

#### Modify Linux cmdline

Display the current contents of file `/boot/cmdline.txt`:

```text
root@rpi3pmv38:~# cat /boot/cmdline.txt
console=serial0,115200 console=tty1 root=PARTUUID=ff8e3abf-02 rootfstype=ext4 fsck.repair=yes rootwait quiet splash plymouth.ignore-serial-consoles
root@rpi3pmv38:~#
```

Edit the boot configuration file according to the suggestions in the previous error message

```bash
sudo vi /boot/cmdline.txt
```

Finally, verify that the command-line has changed accordingly:

```text
root@rpi3pmv38:~# cat /boot/cmdline.txt
console=serial0,115200 console=tty1 root=PARTUUID=ff8e3abf-02 rootfstype=ext4 fsck.repair=yes rootwait quiet splash plymouth.ignore-serial-consoles cgroup_memory=1 cgroup_enable=memory
root@rpi3pmv38:~#
```

Reboot to ensure that the Linux kernel will use the updated command-line.

After the Raspberry Pi has rebooted you may inspect the Linux command-line with the following command:

```text
pi@rpi3pmv38:~ $ cat /proc/cmdline
coherent_pool=1M 8250.nr_uarts=0 snd_bcm2835.enable_compat_alsa=0 snd_bcm2835.enable_hdmi=1 video=HDMI-A-1:1920x1080M@60 vc_mem.mem_base=0x3ec00000 vc_mem.mem_size=0x40000000  console=ttyS0,115200 console=tty1 root=PARTUUID=ff8e3abf-02 rootfstype=ext4 fsck.repair=yes rootwait quiet splash plymouth.ignore-serial-consoles cgroup_memory=1 cgroup_enable=memory

```

#### Verify that the Agent Node is up-and-running

Verify the cluster configuration using `kubectl`

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

then read the online help to understand how to display the properties of the new node.

If you have [k9s - the Kubernetes CLI](https://k9scli.io/) installed, the procedure is even more intuitive:

```bash
