# HOWTO Create a landing page on Netlify

## Introduction

This document is a detailed walkthrough of the steps performed to create a landing page on <https://baroloteam.online>.

## Step-by-step instructions

### Register a domain name

Choose your preferred domain registrar and buy an available domain.

In our example I logged into <https://register.it> and purchased `baroloteam.online`.

If you already have a source project select the first option and provide the requested information.

In our case [baroloteam.online#1](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/baroloteam.online/issues/1) was still open so I chose **Start from a template** instead.

A few templates will be proposed which you can start from:
