## How to load the project on your mobile device

* [ ] Start the "LEGO&reg; Powered Up" app on your device
* [ ] Create a new blank project, then close the app
* [ ] Open the Android File Manager and navigate to the folder
  "Internal Storage/Android/data/com.lego.common.poweredup/files/Activities"
* [ ] Find the latest subfolder that belongs to your blank project.
  You should overwrite the `program.json` file there with the one present in this directory
